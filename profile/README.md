## Background - Swiss Code of Obligations

By introducing a non-financial reporting obligation, Switzerland is following suit with the law that has already existed in the EU since 2014. However, there is a great lack of transparency with regard to compliance with the reporting obligation: It is unclear which companies are specifically subject to the legal obligation and it is very time-consuming to obtain an overview of which of these companies actually comply with their obligation. This lack of transparency makes it very difficult for civil society to monitor compliance with the law and to hold companies accountable.

## Project Summary

With businessresponsibility.ch, we are building a digital platform that enables citizens, activists and non-governmental organizations to check whether and how Swiss companies report on sustainability and human rights issues, as required by the new non-financial reporting obligation. The businessresponsibility.ch platform closes the information gap and empowers civil society to demand the information required by the law.

On businessresponsibility.ch, interested parties can quickly and easily see which companies comply with the non-financial reporting obligation. The digital platform identifies, collects, analyzes and publishes non-financial reporting data from hundreds of Swiss companies and makes this information available free of charge.

Based on this data, businessresponsibility.ch enables the analysis of corporate reporting in Switzerland and thus allows civil society, authorities, legislators and last but not least the business community itself to gain a fact-based and always up-to-date insight into the development and progress of non-financial reporting in Switzerland.

## Team

We are an interdisciplinary team of political scientists, economists, environmental activists and software developers that support the businessresponsibility.ch project. This is a non-profit startup project that aims to strengthen transparency and democratic oversight of the human rights performance of Swiss companies.

We are building a digital platform to monitor company performance vis a vis non-financial reporting obligations. We are currently funded by the Prototype Fund, which supports innovative open source projects that strengthen democratic participation in Switzerland through digital solutions.
